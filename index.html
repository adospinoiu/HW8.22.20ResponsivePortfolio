        I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science in Material Science and
        Engineering. I was fortunate enough to get a job in Tucson with a small company making x-ray machines and
        quickly advanced to be the production manager. While working in industry full-time, I decided to pursue a
        masters degree at the University of Arizona and in 2018 completed a Master of Engineering in Material Science
        and Engineering with a focus on Innovation, Sustainability & Entrepreneurship.

        Nearly a decade into my career and I have accumulated experience in personnel management, operations management,
        business management, inventory management and quality management. Alot of my experience has been accumulate by
        trial-and-error. Undeniably alot of errors. But that's the best way to learn: take risks, make mistakes, learn
        from them, and then move on and apply what you have learned. "We Learn From Failure, Not from Success" -- Bram
        Stoker

        So why am I purusing coding? Why not!? I'm only a quarter of the way into my career. Who knows what's going to
        happen over the next 30 years. I don't know, you don't know, nobody knows. I do know with 100% certinity that
        growth is the only way forward. I have a need ... (just as I have a need for oxygen to survive) ... a need to
        keep growing, keep learning, keep adding skill sets, keep being agile, keep opening windows and doors. The
        alternative is stagnation ... which ultimately leads to feelings of "I wish I had when I was younger ..."
